## Intermediate filament dataset

The dataset consists of 5 image sequences in the format TIFF. Each of them contains a ground truth trajectories at ./Sequence/[Sequence ID]/ground_truth . 
The ground truth trajectory data is stored in ZIP-files, which contain CSV-files describing the position of a filament.
The name of a CSV-file corresponds to an index of the frame in a sequence.
Each CSV-file contains two columns: x- and y-coordinate of a filament curve.

More information about the dataset is in the table below:
